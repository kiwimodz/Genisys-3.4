# Genisys BO2 - Open Source Release

We are proud to release our **Genisys BO2** mod menu as open source! It might not be the prettiest source out there, but we hope it helps anyone who's still working on Black Ops II mods for the PS3.

## About

Genisys BO2 was the go-to menu for slapping pubs or general HvH'ing, providing both non-host and host functionalities / exploits. Now, weâ€™re sharing the source code with the community to encourage further development and innovation.
